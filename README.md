## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing multiple users to collaborate on code development. Key concepts:

1. Repository (Repo): Central storage for project files.
2. Commit: Saving changes with a description (commit message).
3. Branch: Parallel versions of the repository.
4. Merge: Integrating changes from one branch into another.
5. Tag: Snapshot of a specific commit.

Benefits of Version Control:

1. Track changes and history.
2. Collaborate on code.
3. Manage different versions.
4. Roll back to previous versions.
5. Ensure data integrity.

GitHub:

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control using Git. Its popularity stems from:

1. Ease of use.
2. Scalability.
3. Collaboration features (pull requests, issues).
4. Large community and ecosystem.
5. Integration with other tools (CI/CD, project management).

Project Integrity:

Version control helps maintain project integrity by:

1. Preventing data loss.
2. Detecting and resolving conflicts.
3. Tracking changes and accountability.
4. Enabling rollbacks.
5. Facilitating collaboration.
